KnetMiner
===========

KnetMiner is a web application to search and visualise genome-scale knowledge networks. It is used by scientists in academia and industry to accelerate gene-trait discovery research. KnetMiner offers features such as keyword, gene list and genome region search, query refinement, gene ranking, gene set enrichment analysis and interactive visualisation of knowledge networks and genomic information. The web app can be deployed on site or in the AWS cloud using Docker (see wiki). Examples of free and public KnetMiners are available at www.knetminer.org. KnetMiner also offers a set of high-level web API endpoints to access and visualise the knowledge networks from other applications (see wiki).
