Deletes Docker-generated data and configuration files on a Docker volume (ie, local folder), so that the Knetminer
container can regenerate fresh versions of the new files.

For instance, $myname /home/knetminer-datasets/wheat will clean-up the config/ and data/ subdirectories under the
targeted wheat/ directory. config/ is completely deleted, since its contents are completely generated by our Docker
container, data is left with the knowledge-network.oxl file, which is the only starting input the container needs to 
be provided from the outside.
